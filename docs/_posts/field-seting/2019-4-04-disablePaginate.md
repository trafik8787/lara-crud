#### Pagination is enabled by default. It is not recommended to disable it. You have a lot of entries in the database table. This can make it difficult for the page to load into the browser.

#### $this->disablePaginate(<span style="color: #693">bollean</span> true)


`
Example:
$this->disablePaginate(false);
